## What's is this course?
- Intermediate level survey course
- Programming and problem solving with applications


## Definition
Algorithms: Method for solving a problem  
Data structures: Method to store information  
Program = Algorithms + Data structures  


## Topics

### Part I

1- Data types: stack, queue, bag, union find, priority queue  
2- Sorting: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sorts  
3- Searching: BST, red-black BST, hash table  

### Part II
4- Graphs: BFS, DFS, Prime, Kruskal, Dijkstra  
5- Strings: KMP, regular expresssion, TST, Huffman, LZW  
6- Advanced: B-tee, suffix array, maxflow  

  
## Why Algorithms is so important?
Algorithms all around us  
Internet: Web search, packet routing, distribute file sharing, ...  
Biology: Human genome project, protein folding, ...  
Computers: Circuit layout, file system, compilers, ...  
Computer graphics: Movies, Video games, virtual reality, ...  
Security: Cell phones, e-commerce, voting machines, ...  
Multimedia: MP3, JPG, Divx, HDTV, face recognition, ...  
Social networks: Recommendations, news feeds, advertisments, ...  
Physics: N-body simulation, particle collision simulation, ...  


### Steps for solving the problem
1. Model the problem  
2. Find an algorithm to solve it  
3. Fast enough? Fits in memory?  
4. If not, figure out why  
5. Find a way to address the problem  
6. Iterate until satisfied  

### The scientific method
### Mathematical analysis

## Dynamic connectivity
Application for this:
1. Pixels in a digital photo  
2. Computers in network  
3. Friends in a social network  
4. Transistors in a computer chip  
5. Elements in a mathematical set  
6. Variables names in Fortran program  
7. Metallic sites in a composite system  

## Properties
1. Reflexive: p is connected to q  
2. Symmetric: if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p  
3. Transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r


## Quick find (Eager approach)
1. Data structure
- Integer array id[] of size N  
- Interpretation: p and q are conncted (iff) if and only if they have the same id
