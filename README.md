## What's is this course?
- Intermediate level survey course
- Programming and problem solving with applications


## Definition
`Algorithms`: Method for solving a problem  
`Data structures`: Method to store information  
`Program = Algorithms + Data structures` 


## Topics

### Part I

1. Data types: stack, queue, bag, union find, priority queue  
2. Sorting: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, radix sorts  
3. Searching: BST, red-black BST, hash table  

### Part II
4. Graphs: BFS, DFS, Prime, Kruskal, Dijkstra  
5. Strings: KMP, regular expresssion, TST, Huffman, LZW  
6. Advanced: B-tee, suffix array, maxflow  

  
## Why Algorithms is so important?
Algorithms all around us  
1. Internet: Web search, packet routing, distribute file sharing, ...  
2. Biology: Human genome project, protein folding, ...  
3. Computers: Circuit layout, file system, compilers, ...  
4. Computer graphics: Movies, Video games, virtual reality, ...  
5. Security: Cell phones, e-commerce, voting machines, ...  
6. Multimedia: MP3, JPG, Divx, HDTV, face recognition, ...  
7. Social networks: Recommendations, news feeds, advertisments, ...  
8. Physics: N-body simulation, particle collision simulation, ...  


### Steps for solving the problem
1. Model the problem  
2. Find an algorithm to solve it  
3. Fast enough? Fits in memory?  
4. If not, figure out why  
5. Find a way to address the problem  
6. Iterate until satisfied  

### The scientific method
### Mathematical analysis

## Dynamic connectivity
Application for this:
1. Pixels in a digital photo  
2. Computers in network  
3. Friends in a social network  
4. Transistors in a computer chip  
5. Elements in a mathematical set  
6. Variables names in Fortran program  
7. Metallic sites in a composite system  

## Properties
1. Reflexive: p is connected to q  
2. Symmetric: if p is connected to q, then q is connected to p  
3. Transitive: if p is connected to q and q is connected to r, then p is connected to r


## Quick find (Eager approach)
1. Data structure
- Integer array id[] of size N  
- Interpretation: p and q are conncted (iff) if and only if they have the same id  

| Initialize  | Union | Find |
| ----------- | ----- |------|
| N           | N     |1     |

- Quick find defect: Union too expensive
